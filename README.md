# Sketch-to-Pic

## Pic-to-Sketch
The Pic-to-Sketch program turns a given set of pictures into sketches for each. It also creates a dataset of these pictures so that they can be fed into the Sketch-to-Pic program to train the model for picture generation

## Sketch-to-Pic_GAN
The Sketch-to-Pic_GAN generates a picture based on a given sketch representation. This is done by training a GAN (Generational Adversarial Network) on a set of pictrues, and accompanying sketches of various detail representing each picture. For additional information on GAN you can checkout my [blog post](https://ngeiger4.wixsite.com/ai-in-policing/post/to-gan-or-not-to-gan). If you'd like a more in-depth look into GANs I reccomend this [post](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-generative-adversarial-networks-gans/) by Jason Brownlee.
