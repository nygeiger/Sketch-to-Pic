# Sketch-to-Pic

## Pic-to-Sketch
The Pic-to-Sketch program turns a given set of pictures into sketches for each. It also creates a dataset of these pictures so that they can be fed into the Sketch-to-Pic program to train the model for picture generation.

## Sketch-to-Pic_GAN
The Sketch-to-Pic_GAN generates a picture based on a given sketch representation. This is done by training a GAN (Generational Adversarial Network) on a set of pictrues, and accompanying sketches of various detail representing each picture.
